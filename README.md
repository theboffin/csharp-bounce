Bouncing Ball demo in C#.Net

Console Mode demonstration of Bouncing Ball in C#.Net, using https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/tree/v1_release for controlling the console I/O

The Demo allows you to add numerous balls (or remove them down to 1), and control the speed.   Each ball is randomly positioned, and has a random bounce direction as well as a random colour.
Each ball has a tail tracking the last 10 places the ball was.
